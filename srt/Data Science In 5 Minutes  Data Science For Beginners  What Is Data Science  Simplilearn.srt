0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.000
Are you one of the many who dreams of becoming a data scientist?

2
0:00:04.000 --> 0:00:08.000
Keep watching this video if you're passionate about data science because we will tell you

3
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:10.000
how does the dream work under the hood?

4
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:12.000
Am I as a data scientist?

5
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:16.000
Let's see how a day in a life course while she's working on a data science project.

6
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:20.000
Well, it is very important to understand the business problem first.

7
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:22.000
In our meeting with the clients,

8
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:24.000
Am I asked relevant questions?

9
0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:28.000
Understands and defines objectives for the problem that needs to be tackled?

10
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:32.000
She's a cutest soul who asks a lot of advice.

11
0:00:32.000 --> 0:00:34.000
One of the many traits of a good data scientist.

12
0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:38.000
Now, she cares up for data acquisition.

13
0:00:38.000 --> 0:00:40.000
To gather and scrape data from multiple sources like web servers,

14
0:00:40.000 --> 0:00:44.000
logs, databases, APIs, and online depositories.

15
0:00:44.000 --> 0:00:48.000
Oh, it seems like finding the right data takes both time and effort.

16
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:52.000
After the data is gathered, come data preparation.

17
0:00:52.000 --> 0:00:56.000
This step involves data cleaning and data transformation.

18
0:00:56.000 --> 0:01:02.000
Data cleaning is the most time consuming process as it involves handling many complex scenarios.

19
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:06.000
Here, Am I dealing with inconsistent data types,

20
0:01:06.000 --> 0:01:10.000
miss failed attributes, missing values, duplicate values, and whatnot.

21
0:01:10.000 --> 0:01:16.000
Then, in data transformation, she modifies the data based on defined mapping rules.

22
0:01:16.000 --> 0:01:22.000
In a project, ETL tools like talent and infamatica are used to perform complex transformations

23
0:01:22.000 --> 0:01:24.000
that helps the team to understand the data structure better.

24
0:01:24.000 --> 0:01:28.000
Then, understanding what you actually can do with your data is very crucial.

25
0:01:28.000 --> 0:01:32.000
For that, Am I does exploratory data analysis?

26
0:01:32.000 --> 0:01:38.000
With the help of EDA, she defines and defines the selection of feature labels that will be used in the

27
0:01:38.000 --> 0:01:42.000
model development. But what if Am I skip step? She might end up choosing the wrong way to

28
0:01:42.000 --> 0:01:48.000
use which will produce an inaccurate model. Does exploratory data analysis becomes the most

29
0:01:48.000 --> 0:01:52.000
important step. Now, she proceeds to the core activity of a data science project.

30
0:01:52.000 --> 0:01:58.000
Which is data modeling. She will rapidly apply type 4 machine learning techniques like

31
0:01:58.000 --> 0:02:06.000
Canon, decision tree, knife base, to the data to identify the model that best fits the business requirement.

32
0:02:06.000 --> 0:02:12.000
She trains the models on the training data set and test them to select the best performing model.

33
0:02:12.000 --> 0:02:14.000
Am I prefers Python for modeling the data?

34
0:02:14.000 --> 0:02:18.000
However, it can also be done using R and SAS.

35
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:23.200
Well, the trickiest part is not yet over. Visualization and communication.

36
0:02:23.200 --> 0:02:28.400
Am I made the clients again to communicate with business findings in a simple and effective

37
0:02:28.400 --> 0:02:34.000
manner to convince the stakeholders? She uses tools like Tablo, Power BI and ClickView.

38
0:02:34.000 --> 0:02:38.000
That can help her in creating powerful reports and dashboards.

39
0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:44.000
And then finally, she deploys and maintains the model. She tests the selected model in a pre-production

40
0:02:44.000 --> 0:02:49.200
environment before deploying it in the production environment. This is the best practice right?

41
0:02:49.200 --> 0:02:55.440
After successfully deploying it, she uses reports and dashboards to get real-time analytics.

42
0:02:55.440 --> 0:02:59.280
Further, she also monitors and maintains the projects performance.

43
0:02:59.280 --> 0:03:02.400
Well, that's how Emma completes the data science project.

44
0:03:02.400 --> 0:03:07.840
We have seen the daily routine of a data scientist is a whole lot of fun, has a lot of interesting

45
0:03:07.840 --> 0:03:13.280
aspects and comes with its own share of challenges. Now, let's see how data science is

46
0:03:13.360 --> 0:03:19.200
changing the world. Data science techniques along with genomic data provide a deeper understanding

47
0:03:19.200 --> 0:03:25.440
of genetic issues in reaction to particular drugs and diseases. Logistic companies like DHL,

48
0:03:25.440 --> 0:03:29.840
FedEx, have discovered the best rules to ship the best suited time to deliver.

49
0:03:29.840 --> 0:03:34.480
The best mode of transport to choose does leading to cost efficiency.

50
0:03:34.480 --> 0:03:39.280
With data science, it is possible to not only predict employee attrition,

51
0:03:39.280 --> 0:03:44.080
but to also understand the key variables that influence employee turnover.

52
0:03:44.080 --> 0:03:49.840
Also, the airline companies can now easily predict flight delay and notify the passengers

53
0:03:49.840 --> 0:03:55.360
beforehand to enhance their travel experience. Well, if you're wondering, there are various rules

54
0:03:55.360 --> 0:04:01.760
offered to a data scientist. Like data analyst, machine learning engineer, deep learning engineer,

55
0:04:01.760 --> 0:04:07.840
data engineer, and of course data scientists. The median base salaries of the data scientists

56
0:04:07.840 --> 0:04:15.360
can range from $95,000 to $165,000. So that was about the data science. I already

57
0:04:15.360 --> 0:04:21.920
did a data scientist. If yes, then start today. The world of data needs you. That's all from my

58
0:04:21.920 --> 0:04:26.240
side today. Thank you for watching. Comment below the next topic that you want to learn and
