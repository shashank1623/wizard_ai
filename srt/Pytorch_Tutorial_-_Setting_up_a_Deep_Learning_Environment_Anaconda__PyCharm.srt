1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
In this video, I'm going to show you all this step to set up a deep learning environment using anaconda and PyThrum.

2
0:00:17.000 --> 0:00:20.000
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to download anaconda.

3
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:23.000
So we're going to search anaconda download.

4
0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:28.000
We're going to go to that first page and we're going to click on this download.

5
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:30.000
It's going to take us to the bottom of the page.

6
0:00:30.000 --> 0:00:34.000
And then we're just going to take the installation that's for our RPC.

7
0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:37.000
So I have Windows 64 bit.

8
0:00:37.000 --> 0:00:42.000
While that is downloading, we can open another tab and we're going to Google PyThrum.

9
0:00:46.000 --> 0:00:47.000
And let's see.

10
0:00:47.000 --> 0:00:50.000
We're going to click download.

11
0:00:50.000 --> 0:00:53.000
And we're just going to take the community the free version.

12
0:00:53.000 --> 0:00:54.000
It's good enough.

13
0:00:54.000 --> 0:00:56.000
So we're going to press download.

14
0:00:56.000 --> 0:01:00.000
Now that we have both of those installed, we're going to first install anaconda.

15
0:01:00.000 --> 0:01:02.000
So run as administrator.

16
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:05.000
Then we're just going to press continue or I guess next.

17
0:01:05.000 --> 0:01:06.000
I agree.

18
0:01:06.000 --> 0:01:08.000
And I don't think this matters too much.

19
0:01:08.000 --> 0:01:10.000
I'm just going to pick all users.

20
0:01:10.000 --> 0:01:11.000
And then we're going to do.

21
0:01:11.000 --> 0:01:13.000
That looks fine.

22
0:01:13.000 --> 0:01:14.000
Those are good as default.

23
0:01:14.000 --> 0:01:16.000
And we're just going to install that.

24
0:01:16.000 --> 0:01:18.000
Then you're just going to press next.

25
0:01:18.000 --> 0:01:20.000
And just finish.

26
0:01:20.000 --> 0:01:23.000
So what we're going to do next is what we can do.

27
0:01:23.000 --> 0:01:27.000
We can Google a conda cheat sheet or something like that.

28
0:01:27.000 --> 0:01:32.000
And there's going to tell us pretty much all of the necessary commands.

29
0:01:32.000 --> 0:01:34.000
So we're going to search anaconda.

30
0:01:34.000 --> 0:01:37.000
And you can open this anaconda navigator.

31
0:01:37.000 --> 0:01:39.000
But I always use the prompt.

32
0:01:39.000 --> 0:01:41.000
So we can do everything from there.

33
0:01:41.000 --> 0:01:44.000
To make the font a little bit bigger.

34
0:01:44.000 --> 0:01:47.000
All right.

35
0:01:47.000 --> 0:01:53.000
So in the anaconda here, we can see that we have, for example, conda update conda.

36
0:01:53.000 --> 0:01:54.000
So we can do that.

37
0:01:54.000 --> 0:01:56.000
Alconda update conda.

38
0:01:56.000 --> 0:02:01.000
Just press yes.

39
0:02:01.000 --> 0:02:03.000
That what we could do, for example, is conda info.

40
0:02:03.000 --> 0:02:07.000
It gets me information about the conda that you've downloaded.

41
0:02:07.000 --> 0:02:11.000
Really the only thing that we're going to do here is we're going to do a lot of things.

42
0:02:11.000 --> 0:02:15.000
Really the only thing that we're going to do here is we're going to create an environment.

43
0:02:15.000 --> 0:02:22.000
So how we do that is we do conda create and then high-fin high-fin on name.

44
0:02:22.000 --> 0:02:26.000
And then we're just going to call it deep learning.

45
0:02:26.000 --> 0:02:28.000
And then just create that environment.

46
0:02:28.000 --> 0:02:32.000
We're going to do conda activate deep learning.

47
0:02:32.000 --> 0:02:36.000
And then we're just going to go to PyTorch website.

48
0:02:36.000 --> 0:02:39.000
And on PyTorch website, if we scroll down,

49
0:02:40.000 --> 0:02:42.000
we're going to use, so we're going to set up the build.

50
0:02:42.000 --> 0:02:46.000
So you can choose the stable one or the preview nightly.

51
0:02:46.000 --> 0:02:48.000
I'm just going to pick the preview nightly.

52
0:02:48.000 --> 0:02:50.000
I think it's pretty stable anyways.

53
0:02:50.000 --> 0:02:55.000
And then Windows, conda, Python, and then the latest CUDA version.

54
0:02:55.000 --> 0:02:57.000
So just a little note on this.

55
0:02:57.000 --> 0:03:04.000
If you don't have a CUDA enabled GPU, then you, I'm not sure if you can actually pick this one.

56
0:03:04.000 --> 0:03:06.000
But either way, you wouldn't need it.

57
0:03:06.000 --> 0:03:11.000
So you could just press none for that one and just download the CPU only version.

58
0:03:11.000 --> 0:03:14.000
Although if you don't have a GPU, what are you doing?

59
0:03:14.000 --> 0:03:18.000
We're just going to copy that into the prompt.

60
0:03:18.000 --> 0:03:20.000
We're going to press enter.

61
0:03:20.000 --> 0:03:22.000
And it's going to download a bunch of stuff.

62
0:03:22.000 --> 0:03:24.000
Python, everything we need to use PyTorch.

63
0:03:24.000 --> 0:03:28.000
Just going to press Y and then enter.

64
0:03:28.000 --> 0:03:31.000
One thing here is that PyTorch says 0%.

65
0:03:31.000 --> 0:03:34.000
I think there's something wrong with the loading bar.

66
0:03:34.000 --> 0:03:37.000
So it's been running for a while for me.

67
0:03:37.000 --> 0:03:42.000
So I'm going to do is I'm just going to press enter and then it continues downloading.

68
0:03:42.000 --> 0:03:45.000
Now that that is done, we have our environment.

69
0:03:45.000 --> 0:03:46.000
We have PyTorch.

70
0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:47.000
We have Python.

71
0:03:47.000 --> 0:03:48.000
We have everything we need.

72
0:03:48.000 --> 0:03:53.000
And so the strength of an account is really that you can have these different environments.

73
0:03:53.000 --> 0:03:59.000
And you could have, I don't know, Python 2.7 on one and Python 3.7 on another.

74
0:03:59.000 --> 0:04:01.000
So that can be useful sometimes.

75
0:04:02.000 --> 0:04:06.000
So then we'll just go back to that folder and we're going to install PyTorch.

76
0:04:06.000 --> 0:04:08.000
And then we're going to press next.

77
0:04:08.000 --> 0:04:10.000
The default is fine for me.

78
0:04:10.000 --> 0:04:12.000
So we're just going to press next.

79
0:04:12.000 --> 0:04:16.000
And I'm going to use a this fup short cut.

80
0:04:16.000 --> 0:04:17.000
That's about it.

81
0:04:17.000 --> 0:04:18.000
And I'm going to press next.

82
0:04:18.000 --> 0:04:20.000
I'm going to install that.

83
0:04:20.000 --> 0:04:22.000
And then we're just going to run PyTorch.

84
0:04:22.000 --> 0:04:25.000
I do not import settings because I don't have any.

85
0:04:25.000 --> 0:04:28.000
Then I'm just going to pick the dark yellow.

86
0:04:28.000 --> 0:04:32.000
We're going to change the color scheme or if you want, we're going to change the color scheme.

87
0:04:32.000 --> 0:04:35.000
And then we're going to press next.

88
0:04:35.000 --> 0:04:41.000
And you probably shouldn't do anything here, but I'm going to use a VIM because I like that.

89
0:04:41.000 --> 0:04:43.000
So I'm just going to press here, but you probably shouldn't.

90
0:04:43.000 --> 0:04:46.000
And then I'm going to just press start using PyTorch.

91
0:04:46.000 --> 0:04:50.000
And then the first thing we're going to do before we create any project.

92
0:04:50.000 --> 0:04:54.000
We're going to configure and we're going to do settings.

93
0:04:54.000 --> 0:04:56.000
And in this settings.

94
0:04:57.000 --> 0:05:00.000
We're going to go to the project interpreter.

95
0:05:00.000 --> 0:05:04.000
And at the top right, we're going to press on that wheel.

96
0:05:04.000 --> 0:05:06.000
And we're going to press add.

97
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:09.000
Then we're going to go down to kind of environment.

98
0:05:09.000 --> 0:05:11.000
We're going to do existing environment.

99
0:05:11.000 --> 0:05:14.000
Then on the existing environment, you should have the deep,

100
0:05:14.000 --> 0:05:17.000
the deep learning that you just created or whatever name you took.

101
0:05:17.000 --> 0:05:20.000
Then we're going to press make available to all project.

102
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:22.000
And we're just going to press OK.

103
0:05:22.000 --> 0:05:25.000
And that should make that the default one.

104
0:05:25.000 --> 0:05:27.000
We're going to press apply and OK.

105
0:05:27.000 --> 0:05:29.000
Then we're going to do create new project.

106
0:05:29.000 --> 0:05:33.000
We're going to call it something like test 123.

107
0:05:33.000 --> 0:05:37.000
And then we're going to use the existing interpreter.

108
0:05:37.000 --> 0:05:41.000
And we're going to use the Python 3.8, the deep learning one.

109
0:05:41.000 --> 0:05:42.000
We're going to do create.

110
0:05:42.000 --> 0:05:44.000
It's might take a while to run.

111
0:05:44.000 --> 0:05:46.000
We're just going to wait for it.

112
0:05:46.000 --> 0:05:47.000
All right.

113
0:05:47.000 --> 0:05:49.000
And then we can press on this folder right here.

114
0:05:49.000 --> 0:05:51.000
Or I guess we can do it up here as well.

115
0:05:51.000 --> 0:05:52.000
File new.

116
0:05:52.000 --> 0:05:54.000
And we're just going to press the Python file.

117
0:05:54.000 --> 0:05:57.000
And we're going to do test.

118
0:05:57.000 --> 0:06:00.000
And then what we can do is, so this text is kind of small.

119
0:06:00.000 --> 0:06:04.000
I'm just going to go to settings editor font.

120
0:06:04.000 --> 0:06:06.000
I'm just going to change this to 20.

121
0:06:06.000 --> 0:06:09.000
And then you could just hide that one.

122
0:06:09.000 --> 0:06:11.000
See that you have more space.

123
0:06:11.000 --> 0:06:17.000
And then you can start, you know, import torch print torch dot version.

124
0:06:17.000 --> 0:06:23.000
And then you can run that up here or the old shift F10.

125
0:06:25.000 --> 0:06:28.000
And then you get the version that you have.

126
0:06:28.000 --> 0:06:32.000
Now what I like to do is I like to use another color scheme.

127
0:06:32.000 --> 0:06:36.000
So I'm just going to show you how to get that one as well.

128
0:06:36.000 --> 0:06:37.000
And for that, we're just going to Google.

129
0:06:37.000 --> 0:06:39.000
Goove box.

130
0:06:39.000 --> 0:06:41.000
And we're going to go box.

131
0:06:41.000 --> 0:06:42.000
PyThrum.

132
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:44.000
And then we're going to go to that link.

133
0:06:44.000 --> 0:06:47.000
And so what it should recognize.

134
0:06:47.000 --> 0:06:49.000
If you just wait for like 10 seconds.

135
0:06:49.000 --> 0:06:52.000
It's going to install to ID because it's going to recognize that you have

136
0:06:52.000 --> 0:06:53.000
a PyThrum installed.

137
0:06:53.000 --> 0:06:54.000
You're going to press that one.

138
0:06:54.000 --> 0:06:56.000
And then you're going to go back to PyThrum.

139
0:06:56.000 --> 0:06:59.000
And you're just going to press OK.

140
0:06:59.000 --> 0:07:00.000
And accept.

141
0:07:00.000 --> 0:07:01.000
Then that looks awful.

142
0:07:01.000 --> 0:07:03.000
But we're going to go to settings.

143
0:07:03.000 --> 0:07:05.000
We're going to go to font again.

144
0:07:05.000 --> 0:07:07.000
And we're going to do current editor font.

145
0:07:07.000 --> 0:07:09.000
We're going to press that one.

146
0:07:09.000 --> 0:07:14.000
And then we're going to change this group box from light to dark medium.

147
0:07:14.000 --> 0:07:16.000
And we're just going to press apply.

148
0:07:16.000 --> 0:07:19.000
Now it looks like from the beginning of the video.

149
0:07:19.000 --> 0:07:20.000
What I like to do as well.

150
0:07:20.000 --> 0:07:23.000
I like to do view appearance and then enter Zen mode.

151
0:07:23.000 --> 0:07:26.000
So that it's looks pretty clean.

152
0:07:26.000 --> 0:07:33.000
And then you know, you can do everything that you want from from using PyThrum.

153
0:07:33.000 --> 0:07:36.000
So now you have all the basic packages really.

154
0:07:36.000 --> 0:07:38.000
So start doing some some deep learning.

155
0:07:38.000 --> 0:07:42.000
If you run into any issues setting up your deep learning environment,

156
0:07:42.000 --> 0:07:44.000
using an economy, then let me know.

157
0:07:44.000 --> 0:07:46.000
And I will try my best to help you out.

158
0:07:46.000 --> 0:07:49.000
So that you can really just start to focus on learning this stuff.

159
0:07:49.000 --> 0:07:50.000
Which is the goal.

160
0:07:50.000 --> 0:07:53.000
With that's thank you so much for watching the video.

161
0:07:53.000 --> 0:07:56.000
I hope you find it useful and I hope to see you in the next video.
